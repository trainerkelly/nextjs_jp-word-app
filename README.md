# About the App

I had created a typing game of sorts for studying Japanese vocabulary more quickly and efficently. (https://github.com/trainerkelly/jp-wordapp)

The original is written with no frameworks – just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am learning how to use Next.js and I thought what better way to learn how to use Next.js than converting an application I already made?! So I am.

Follow for updates, though I plan on doing another version in the future that's a bit more involved. So I guess just watch my account for that.
